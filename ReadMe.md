I want to build a simple web app that can play two YouTube videos simultaneously on the same page.

This concept is not currently relevant to my upcoming opportunities so I am tabling for now.

Potential features to add:
-combine videos as a playlist into one video by submitting their video IDs and start/stop times
-do the same for sound
-post the finished product to their own youtube channel
-tweet the service that helped them make it :D
